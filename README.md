# NuPack_Calc_JS
Redoing the Nulogy coding challenge using JS and Jasmine <br/>

Improvements to be made based on feedback from original Calculator (https://github.com/JMazzucco/NuPack_Markup_Calc) <br/>
-Run the test suite without inputs. <br/>
-UI could have been extracted to another file, that way we wouldn't have to enter input to run tests. <br/>
-Use integration tests that test the whole calculator. <br/>
-Separate the CLI code from the part of the code that does calculation. <br/>
-Introduce some modules, so that the global namespace does not get polluted. <br/>
-Introduce constants for magic numbers. <br/>
-Code is not reusable because it is procedural. Extract classes to organize code, and encapsulate state.
